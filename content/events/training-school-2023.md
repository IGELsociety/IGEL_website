## About Event

This year’s IGEL Training School will take place from **October 3rd till October 4th**, just after the IGEL conference. In line with the theme of the 2023 conference, the School will cover the topic of **“Empirical Perspectives Beyond Literature”**. Our invited speakers include **Christine Knoop, Rebecca Chamberlain and Shannon Whitten**, who all research different narrative and artistic disciplines from an empirical perspective.

The event will be held entirely **online**, via Zoom platform. It will run from 15:00h until 18:00h CET time, breaks included. A timetable will be uploaded before the event. There is no fee, as this event is **free** of charge.

Even though IGEL (International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature) is a literary society, the aim of this year’s Training School is to open up a dialogue about empirical perspectives that are narrative-based but go beyond the realm of literature. The scope of IGEL, as shown by this year’s conference theme, _Rhythm, Speed, Path: Spatiotemporal Experiences in Narrative, Poetry, and Drama_, covers a wider range of fields able to accommodate **transdisciplinarity**. Transdisciplinarity is a research strategy that intermingles different disciplines in order to create a **holistic approach in the sciences**.

Early career researchers taking part in the School will have the chance to learn about empirical perspectives in narrative research that cover fields as varied as style, reception, psychology and aesthetics or dance therapy. The participants will learn about hands-on projects and actual transdisciplinary lines of research being conducted by the invited speakers, along with the basics of methodological research under this perspective. During the training school **attendees will have the chance to think through the principles of transdisciplinarity for their own projects through hands-on sessions.**
