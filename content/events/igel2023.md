## Venue

Monopoli is a little town near Bari in Puglia, a region in Southern Italy. Its characteristic historical centre of early medieval origin overlooks the sea and it's surrounded by high walls facing the Adriatic Sea. During the free time, it will be possible for you to admire churches, noble palaces, squares, ancient alleys, the harbour, and even a few beaches.

The conference will be held in Monopoli’s **Diocesan Museum**, located in the town’s historic center, next to the Basilica of the Madonna della Madia. 

Plenary sessions will take place in the great hall on the ground floor, whereas parallel sessions will be held in other rooms upstairs, between the first and the second floor. Reception stand and coffee breaks will be in the [building](https://goo.gl/maps/r4gUCpzK4xJgDfYn8) across the square, in front of the Basilica.

Address: [Via Cattedrale, 26, Monopoli (BA), Italy](https://goo.gl/maps/nUNu5fKmZ74cLMys8)

Tel.:  +39 (0)80 748002	

Website: https://museodiocesanomonopoli.com/en/

Monopoli’s Diocesan Museum was established in 2002, in the venues of the ancient Episcopal Seminary, founded originally in 1668. The Museum architecture and its collection testify Monopoli’s transculturality: the town has always been a meeting-port between the West and the East, having been under the influence of the Byzantines, the Angevins, the Aragones and the Venetians. The rooms of the Museum display paintings, icons, manuscripts, and various manufactures of great artistic value. The atmosphere is particularly linked to the religious and cultural history of the area, which has been a centre of pilgrimage for several centuries. The conference is obviously a secular event, but we'd like to mention that religious elements will be visible at the venue.

## Call for Papers

The International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature (IGEL) invites submissions to the 2023 conference across all areas of the empirical study of literature and media, including but not limited to, cognitive processing of literature, literature/media and culture, aesthetics, neuroscience and literature, literary reception, reading and emotion, historical study of literature, and corpus analysis of literature.

This year’s conference is co-located with [ENN 2023](https://enn7.netlify.app), the conference of the European Narratology Network, and the common theme is *Rhythm, Speed, Path: Spatiotemporal Experiences in Narrative, Poetry, and Drama*. Submissions related to this topic will be given priority but contributions on other topics are also welcome. **The deadline for submission is ~~24 February 2023~~ 10 March 2023**.  

The conference will be conducted in a **hybrid format**. All spoken presentations will be pre-recorded videos of approximately 20 minutes to be delivered about 2 weeks before the conference. During the conference sessions, presenters will give a 5 minutes summary of their work and 15 minutes will be dedicated to Q&A. The platform used for the conference is called [Concordance](https://igelsociety.org/concordance/). Poster presentations will be available on Concordance but presenters can choose to display them at the conference venue as well.

The review committee requires a summary of the presentation. The summary should be 600-800 words and contain a short introduction, a description of the methods as appropriate, and a brief conclusion. We also welcome theoretical papers (as long as they are focused on the field of empirical literary studies) and works in progress. For works in progress, we particularly recommend the poster format.

Acceptance decisions will be communicated to the authors by 15 April 2023. 

### Submission Requirements

Send submissions via the [submission form](https://forms.gle/UUQShkRrMadk29uYA), including the following information:

- Name of first author (First, Last and Title) and affiliation
- Email of corresponding author 
- List co-authors (names and affiliations) 
- Title of presentation
- Three to five relevant keywords 
- Short description (100 words max) 
- Long abstract (800 words max, references excluded) 

Please indicate the format (poster, paper, symposium paper) by ticking the appropriate box.

### More Information

**Symposia**

- Name of Contact author (First, Last and Title)  
- Email of the contact person  
- List all presenters
- Title of Symposium
- Three to five relevant keywords

Just like the spoken presentation, all symposia presentations will be pre-recorded with synchronous Q&A sessions during the conference.

Chair/discussant may also serve as speaker, i.e. fill one of the maximum of four slots in a symposium. Accepted symposium proposals will then have to be submitted following the same guidelines as regular proposals by using the online registration described above. 

### Outstanding Student Paper Award

IGEL will give an Outstanding Student Paper Award. In order to be considered for this award, the first author must be a graduate student, and the student’s supervisor must send a recommendation to igel2023conference[at]gmail.com describing the student’s contribution to the research project. First authors should indicate the eligibility of their submission using the provided checkbox during the submission process. 

### Acceptance Policies

- Proposal needs to be relevant to our society’s mandate and members 
- Proposal needs to be of high quality (therefore paper proposals need to be anonymized, so authors cannot be accepted or rejected on name alone) 
- Proposal can be empirical (naturalistic, experimental or computational) or theoretical (but pertaining to the field of empirical literary studies) in nature 
- We will not accept more than one proposal from the same author (the only exception being authors who can clearly show that they are working in two different research areas) → this policy is to prevent senior researchers from dominating the conference 

We are an inclusive society, which means early career researchers or researchers from economically-disadvantaged countries will not be discriminated against:

- The review process is blind
- Comments may be made by reviewers to authors about the need to improve English use, but a bad command of the English language is not a reason to reject a proposal
- Registration fees are lowered
- We provide bursaries of maximum 400 euro each for Master and PhD students with no travel funds. There is a limited number of bursaries available.

If you are eligible and would like to request a lower fee or a bursary, please write to the IGEL treasurer, Marloes Mak: marloes.mak[at]ru.nl
