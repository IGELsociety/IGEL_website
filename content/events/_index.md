#### Past training events
In 2015 IGEL officially started its training school program. Some of the biennial conferences before that had included summer institutes for early career researchers, which were a great success. The training school program was set up to make the biennial pre-conference training school a fixed staple of every IGEL conference, but also to organise general training schools on empirical research methods, experiment design and statistics in between conferences to attract new members to our society.
