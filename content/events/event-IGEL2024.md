Aachen is a fantastic little city of 250,000 inhabitants. Its history dates back 5000 years and involves having been a Roman spa town and later the seat of Charlemagne in the 8th century. The University and conference venue is a five-minute walk from Aachen’s historic city centre with its famed cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage site. (E-)bike trips of 15 minutes will take you into Belgium and the Netherlands, and a 3-hour train ride will get you to Paris. You can find more information [here](https://www.aachen-tourismus.de/en/).
