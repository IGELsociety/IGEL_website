## Program

Details of the full program will be ready later.

The IGEL 2025 conference will take place over 2 full days, on June 5th and June 6th.

- On June 4th, the day before the start of the IGEL 2024 conference in Austin, there will be a welcome session for registration and "meet and great" with the local organizers. 
- June 5th: parallel sessions from 8.00 am to 5 pm. Conference dinner in the evening.
- June 6th: parallel sessions and closing remarks from 8.00 am to 5 pm. 

## Venue

The conference venue will be announced shortly and it is located in the University district. 

Austin, Texas, is a welcoming and vibrant city, currently the 7th fastest growing metro area in the U.S.
Known as the “Live Music Capital of the World,” Austin has a rich history that blends Texan traditions
with a contemporary, progressive culture.

Outdoor enthusiasts will enjoy the nearby Lady Bird Lake and the expansive Zilker Park,
including the 3-acre Barton Springs Pool (12,000 square meters), where an underground spring keeps
groovy Austinites cool and chill. Austin’s central location also allows for easy day trips to other major
Texas cities like San Antonio and Dallas. For more information, please visit this <a href="https://www.austintexas.org/" target="_blank">link</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uj9ZT9oeOuNUAqD6tAOzYkgkl5aprw2Z33KF0qmron0/edit" target="_blank">Soon’s Austin Checklist</a>.

### How to reach Austin

Austin is accessible by air through the **Austin-Bergstrom International Airport**, which is located just southeast of the city center. The airport provides a wide range of domestic and international flights, connecting Austin directly with major cities across the United States and global destinations. For travelers arriving by air, the airport offers numerous services and transportation options, including taxis, rideshares (e.g., Uber and Lyft), and a public transit system to efficiently reach downtown Austin and surrounding areas. By car, the airport is about 30 minutes away from the city center.

### Accommodation

Please book your stay in advance, as Austin can get quite busy. 
The link below presents 3 hotel options that the organizers selected for your convenience. 
We suggest to book the Moxy Hotel, as it is located near the conference venue.

Please send all submissions via <a href="https://forms.gle/Y4473YSRSfxQwwkq9" target="_blank">this link</a>. Acceptance decisions will be communicated to the authors by 28 February 2025.

### Acceptance Policies

-   Proposal needs to be relevant to our society's mandate and members
-   Proposal needs to be of high quality (therefore paper proposals need to be anonymized, so authors cannot be accepted or rejected on name alone)
-   Proposal can be empirical (naturalistic, experimental or computational) or theoretical (but pertaining to the field of empirical literary studies) in nature
-   We will not accept more than one proposal from the same author (the only exception being authors who can clearly show that they are working in two different research areas) → this policy is to prevent senior researchers from dominating the conference
-   We are an inclusive society, which means early career researchers or researchers from economically-disadvantaged countries will not be discriminated against
-   The review process is blind

### Outstanding Student Paper Award

IGEL will continue its tradition of recognizing outstanding student presentations. In order to be considered for the Outstanding Student Paper Award, the first author must be a graduate student, and the student's supervisor must send a recommendation to igelaustin25@gmail.com describing the student's contribution to the research project. First authors should indicate the eligibility of their submission using the provided checkbox during the submission process.
