## Venue

Austin, Texas, is a welcoming and vibrant city, currently the 7th fastest growing metro area in the U.S.
Known as the “Live Music Capital of the World,” Austin has a rich history that blends Texan traditions
with a contemporary, progressive culture.

The conference will take place at Huston-Tillotson University in Central East Austin, a 15-minute drive
from the Austin-Bergstrom International airport and a 5-minute drive to downtown Austin,
depending on traffic.
Huston-Tillotson University is the first university to be founded in Austin, Texas, and a historically
Black college (HBCU). It is located within a 5-minute walk of a vibrant part of East Austin with
restaurants, breweries, food trucks, live music venues, and hotels. You can check out the location
here. Outdoor enthusiasts will enjoy the nearby Lady Bird Lake and the expansive Zilker Park,
including the 3-acre Barton Springs Pool (12,000 square meters), where an underground spring keeps
groovy Austinites cool and chill. Austin’s central location also allows for easy day trips to other major
Texas cities like San Antonio and Dallas. For more information, please visit this <a href="https://www.austintexas.org/" target="_blank">link</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uj9ZT9oeOuNUAqD6tAOzYkgkl5aprw2Z33KF0qmron0/edit" target="_blank">Soon’s Austin Checklist</a>.

### How to reach Austin

Austin is accessible by air through the **Austin-Bergstrom International Airport**, which is located just southeast of the city center. The airport provides a wide range of domestic and international flights, connecting Austin directly with major cities across the United States and global destinations. For travelers arriving by air, the airport offers numerous services and transportation options, including taxis, rideshares (e.g., Uber and Lyft), and a public transit system to efficiently reach downtown Austin and surrounding areas. By car, the airport is about 30 minutes away from the city center.

## Call for Papers

The call for papers is available under this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-Yl8oAYhEyIbAn4B8sTgtowZQ4_scMR/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">link</a>. 
All spoken presentations will be **pre-recorded videos** of 15-20 minutes to be submitted one month before the conference. During the conference sessions, presenters will give a 5-minute summary of their work and 15-20 minutes will be dedicated to Q&A. The *Concordance* platform will be used for hosting the program, videos, abstracts, posters and online discussions and networking. You can read more about it <a href="https://igelsociety.org/concordance/" target="_blank">here</a>. 
Proposals for paper and poster presentations must contain a short introduction, a description of the methods as appropriate, and a brief conclusion.

### Submission form

Please send all submissions via <a href="https://forms.gle/Y4473YSRSfxQwwkq9" target="_blank">this link</a>. Acceptance decisions will be communicated to the authors by 28 February 2025.

### Acceptance Policies

-   Proposal needs to be relevant to our society's mandate and members
-   Proposal needs to be of high quality (therefore paper proposals need to be anonymized, so authors cannot be accepted or rejected on name alone)
-   Proposal can be empirical (naturalistic, experimental or computational) or theoretical (but pertaining to the field of empirical literary studies) in nature
-   We will not accept more than one proposal from the same author (the only exception being authors who can clearly show that they are working in two different research areas) → this policy is to prevent senior researchers from dominating the conference
-   We are an inclusive society, which means early career researchers or researchers from economically-disadvantaged countries will not be discriminated against
-   The review process is blind

### Outstanding Student Paper Award

IGEL will continue its tradition of recognizing outstanding student presentations. In order to be considered for the Outstanding Student Paper Award, the first author must be a graduate student, and the student's supervisor must send a recommendation to igelaustin25@gmail.com describing the student's contribution to the research project. First authors should indicate the eligibility of their submission using the provided checkbox during the submission process.

### Bursaries

**Amounts:**
  - max €200 for continental applications / €400 for intercontinental applications, plus:
  - Waived conference fee
