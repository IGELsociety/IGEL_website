## Research coalitions
In recent years, IGEL has supported the formation of 21 research coalitions within our community. These coalitions are small groups of 3-8 researchers concerned with specific topics in empirical studies of literature (e.g., literary reading and social cognition, shared literary reading). These coalitions work together to prepare publications, training material or events on their research topic, most recently they formed the basis for the 21 chapters of the [Handbook of Empirical Literary Studies](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110645958/html).

On the left you can find all of our currently active research coalitions grouped per theme (i.e, Modes of Textual Representation; The Form and Function of Literariness; Social Effects of Literary Reading; Narrative Engagement and Experiential Depth; Enhanced Social Well-Being; History, Theory and Empirical Methods). For each coalition you can find its members, their most important publications on the topic, and some relevant resources. 

If you would like to join a research coalition, please contact the specific research coalition's coordinator

### Submitting a Coalition Proposal
If you are interested in starting a new research coalition involving a small group of investigators with records of accomplishment in a specific research area, please send an email to Moniek Kuijpers (IGEL President) who, in turn, will present your proposal to the Board for consideration.

## Modes of Textual Representation

### Effects of Foregrounding
	
<h4>Abstract</h4>
One of the central goals of the empirical study of literature is to determine the nature and function of literary reading. In this, researchers often attribute a decisive role to foregrounding, a phenomenon that occurs either when some aspect of a text is either some form of repetition or unusual in terms of some general norm (external deviation) or deviating from a pattern set up by the text itself (internal deviation). For some, it is key to their understanding of what constitutes literariness, or even art in general. The aim of the foregrounding research coalition is to foster the empirical study of foregrounding, in order to enhance our understanding of what literariness is.

For this we need to distinguish four approaches to the ontology of foregrounding: (1) foregrounding seen as textual procedures (also referred to as deviations and parallelism); (2) foregrounding considered as a phenomenon occurring in the perception of readers (i.e., noticing that something is different in comparison to its context); (3) readers’ experience of foregrounding; and (4) the effects of such experiences in the culture at large. These four conceptions are interdependent and interactive, but only to a degree. To start with, readers will only perceive a deviation if the relevant information about context is available to them (e.g., their knowledge of genre conventions). And if perceived, there are still a number of factors that determine whether and how they interpret the intentionality and purpose of the deviation or parallelism and the whether they experience foregrounding in the sense of an aesthetic or distinctly literary response (e.g., readers’ attitude toward literary values). The research in this coalition focuses on the second and third approach. However, in our interdisciplinary group we will also consider the first, for instance in the formulation of hypotheses, and explore implications for the fourth.

Thus, our research coalition represents (and brings together) a wide range of topics, such as, reader variables that predict susceptibility to foregrounding; the way the interplay between deviation and parallelism affects responses; the relationship between backgrounding and foregrounding, the relation between foregrounding and perceived meaningfulness; foregrounding in other media than literary texts (e.g., film and music).

#### Davide Castiglione
Lecturer in English language and literature, Vilnius University, Lithuania

Davide teaches poetry, stylistics, and other linguistic disciplines. In his research on the stylistics of difficulty he has identified a checklist of linguistic indicators that tend to be foregrounded in difficult poems, thus favouring certain kinds of response over others. Belonging to all linguistic levels, but especially to semantics and pragmatics (discourse), these features are foregrounded both internally (e.g. they are highly salient in defining the texture of the given poem) and externally (e.g. they deviate from prototypical norms of language, both literary and non-literary).

#### Frank Hakemulder
Assistant Professor, Department of Media and Culture Studies, Utrecht University, The Netherlands; Affiliated Full Professor at the Reading Center of Stavanger University, Norway

Frank has a background in literary theory and comparative literature. His research focuses on the effects of reading literary texts on outgroup attitudes and moral self-concept (e.g., The moral laboratory, 2000). He supervises two national research projects in the Netherlands: one pertaining to the experience of being absorbed in fictional worlds (Narrative Absorption, 2017), and the other on how such experiences affect social perception and self concepts (see www.finditinfiction.org). Currently he is investigating how literary reading gives readers a sense of meaningfulness in studies of text qualities (e.g., foregrounding), how readers are instructed to read, reading medium (screen versus paper), and how these interact to generate deeply absorbed, eudaemonic experiences.

### Prosodic and Phonological Effects in Literary Texts

<h4>Abstract</h4>
In many literary genres such as proverbs, poetry, and prose where language is used in an aesthetic manner, semantic and formal components thereof are related to each other in meaningful ways (Jakobson, 1960; Levin 1962; Fabb, 2015). According to literary theory, this results in a pronounced “palpability“ of form (Jakobson, 1960) and, most notably, of sound patterning (Jakobson & Waugh, 1979/2002; Schrott & Jacobs, 2011; Skhlovsky, 1917).

“Sound” in its broadest sense can be understood to comprise an array of linguistic aspects that are bound to diverse formal and semantic features (Jacobs, 2015) and play a particular role for the phonological as well as on the prosodic level of language. Examples include the phonological inventory related to core units such as phonemes and tonemes, phonology-based stylistic devices such as rhyme, meter and other figures of phonological recurrence (Kraxenberger & Menninghaus, 2016; 2017), as well as acoustic, suprasegmental features above single speech sounds. Some of these features regularly interact (such as poetic rhythm and meter) or frequently co-occur and influence each other (such as end rhyme and meter). All these different aspects comprise the particular “melodies” of literary texts, that is, its musical features.

Consequently, these diverse aspects lead to different (re)presentations of sound (abstract-phonological; acoustic-prosodic) that have been investigated in relation to the different perception modes by which they are shaped (silent reading; reading aloud; listening to literary texts read aloud).

The aim of the present contribution is to review the growing body of empirical research that is concerned with the prosodic and phonological effects in literary texts. In doing so, this review aims to identify the prevalent concepts, theories and methods in a systematic way and to point out apparent lacunae of interest for future studies.

### Contextual Meaning-making in Reading: The Role of Affect

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Emotions play a crucial role in how readers process, comprehend and experience texts. This chapter will focus on what we have learned about the emotional aspects of reading by using eye tracking, a methodology that provides detailed information about the time-course of reading processes as they occur online. The chapter will first introduce basic emotional concepts relevant for reading research. It then describes key measures of eye movements used in  previous research focusing on sentence- and text comprehension. We will then review previous eye tracking research on the role of emotions in reading conducted at three levels: word, sentence and text. It seems that while word-level emotion effects have received quite a lot of interest, much less empirical work has been conducted on sentence and text-level phenomena. The lack of empirical evidence is reflected in theoretical accounts, which currently are still under development. Thus, there is a clear need for vigorous empirical research to advance the theoretical work on emotional aspects of reading. This chapter will provide some pointers to future research: It highlights the importance of using naturalistic texts and demands the further development of advanced exploratory, predictive and explanatory computational methods and models in order to foster the understanding of the emotional aspects of reading.

### Empirical Approaches to Poetic Metaphor

<h4>Abstract</h4>

This chapter has two goals:  to present a concise survey of scholarship on empirical studies of poetic metaphor; and to define several major issues seen in such empirical studies that can guide future research in this field.  We will distinguish among three types of experimental methodology employed in this interdisciplinary domain:  a reaction-time study investigating, for example, lexical decisions; the use of questionnaires and rating scales assessing, for example, metaphor aptness; and the use of a thinking-aloud protocol investigating, for example, the process of metaphor comprehension or the experience of affect.  We will then discuss the theoretical issues raised in a close consideration of these studies.  Major questions will include:  Should poetic metaphor be studied in isolation from the context of the poetic text?; Should a literary/poetic tradition be taken into consideration (i.e., Metaphysical poetry; Imagist poetry).  Should similes and metaphors be treated equivalently? In the discussion of the empirical methodologies, major questions will include:  Who should be the readers of the poetic text:  students of literature; students of psychology; professors of literature; poets?  Should the studies of poetic metaphor be necessarily informed both by literary scholarship and cognitive psychology?  What are the methodological strengths, and limitations of the empirical studies?

### Computational Stylistics

<h4>Abstract</h4>

The written substrate of literary works is clearly the basis of all things literary. However, in the empirical study of literature, the textual base has long been secondary to the study of readerly and social-economic dimensions. What is more, following the formalist and structuralist traditions, empirical textual studies have as a rule focused on features of “deviance”, or foregrounding. To recalibrate this situation, the computational stylistics coalition will concentrate on the textual substrate of literary discourse – in formal detail, as well as in quantitative breadth. 

 Following ideas by Gérald Genette (*Fiction and Diction*) as well as Käte Hamburger (*The Logic of Literature*), we will textually examine the dimension of style inasmuch as that of fictional world making. Our aim is to give a new text-based account of what makes literary texts literary: at the levels of (a) *intra-literary discourse*, in comparison with non-literary works, and (b) *inter-literary/non-literary discourse*, in diachronic and synchronous comparison with other (types of) literary texts. We ask whether literature, seen generally, is really typically marked by features that “stick out”, or whether it may be other, more backgrounded features that are indicative. As this research requires large and varied sets of data, as well as reliable and automatized means of textual analyses, we will tap into the computational assets available within the paradigm of “Digital Humanities” and Digital Stylistics”, using big samples of digitized versions of literary texts and text-mining techniques for their analysis (e.g. frequency analyses of features and collocations, keyness, quantitative content analysis, stylometry, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, semantic word embedding).  

*Inductive Stock Taking*
At the highest level, our computational stylistic research wishes to contribute to a descriptive account of the full variety of genres and text types – throughout literary history up to the current date, including canonical as well as popular literary production. It pursues the following open questions about textual indicators of fictionality/literariness:
* *Intra-discourse distribution*: How is language used in specific literary genres across variables such as time, language, nation, and culture? 
* *Inter-discourse distribution*: Do literary texts show features and ensembles of textual feature that are typically literary? What are these? If there are any, are these stable across time and genres? How about cross-cultural variation?

*Literary Features Hunt*
Given the long and relevant tradition of analyzing rhetorical features of style in literature, we also zoom in on features and patterns of deviance that are salient and attract readers’ attention, for example creative metaphorical language use and recurrence of stylistic features:
* *Assessment*: What textual features have been shown to systematically attract (today’s) reader attention or transport them into fictional worlds?
* *Operationalization*: Which of these features may be analyzed by means of computational stylistics, i.e. through formalization and quantification? What tools may be used to this end and in how far do these have to be adapted?
* *Analysis*: How are these features distributed across genres, epochs, cultures, and so on?

Naturally, the latter type of computational analysis may grow out of reader response studies, guide stimuli construction, and generally feed back into reader response studies.

He is the author most recently of *Enumerations: Data and Literary Study* (Chicago 2018). His work concentrates on two principal facets. The first uses data-driven techniques to better understand the social functionality of fictional writing by examining the features that distinguish fictional from non-fictional writing. The second explores cultural inequality and cultural capital with respect to contemporary novel writing I.e., the biases of language, discourse, and representation that surround and maintain cultural hierarchies.

## Modes of Reading Engagement

### Embodied Reading (Simulation, Imagery) 

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Readers experience a number of sensations during reading. We do not – or do not only – process words and sentences in a detached, abstract manner. Instead we can “perceive” what we read about. We see descriptions of scenery. We feel what characters feel. Perhaps we hear the sounds in a story. These sensations tend to be grouped under the umbrella terms 'mental simulation' and ‘mental imagery’.

In this chapter we will give an overview of empirical research on the role of mental simulation during literary reading. We will discuss what mental simulation is, and how it relates to mental imagery. Moreover, we investigate when, under what circumstances mental simulation occurs during literature reading. Finally, we ask what the effect is that mental simulation has on the literary reader’s experience. We will also illustrate the (online) methods used in studying mental simulation, as well as unresolved questions in this field.

### Constructing Inferences (Situation Models)

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Theories of text and discourse comprehension indicate that generating inferences is a critical part of forming a coherent mental model of what we read. However, most of the work in this field has investigated the reading of simple narratives or expository text. This coalition represents the growing interest in the inferential processes that occur when people engage authentic fiction, literature, or other media (e.g., television, film, graphic novels). 

Research in this area has emerged from scholars in literature, linguistics, cognitive psychology, education, and learning science. This research has explored (1) the types of inferences that are generated when reading literature, (2) the processes involved in the construction of these inferences, and (3) how these inferences influence literary comprehension, learning, and experience. It has demonstrated that reading literary works relies on both domain-general and discipline-specific processes, and the amount and types of inferences that are generated are dependent on complex interactions between the text, task, and reader. 

The best means of capturing and evaluating literary-specific inferential processes as they unfold during and after reading is still an ongoing empirical question. Thus far, the research has been dominated by open-ended assessments such as think-aloud protocols and post-reading essays, but other work has employed reading times and recognition tests. The aims of this area of work are to refine and expand theory as well as to advance classroom practices.

#### Sarah Levine
Assistant Professor, Stanford University, USA.

Dr. Levine’s research focuses on the teaching and learning of literary interpretation in under-resourced urban high schools, with an emphasis on the links between in- and out-of-school interpretive practices. She is especially interested in the role of affect and emotion in interpretive reading, and ways that affect and emotion can play a more significant role in classroom reading. Before academia, Dr. Levine taught secondary English at a Chicago public school. Her primary goal as teacher and researcher is to help shape teaching and learning in secondary English so that literary reading can be the rich, transactional experience it was meant to be. Dr. Levine studies the effects of "affective evaluation" on literary interpretation, looking at ways that interpretation of authorial tone and identification of individual judgments and affective responses can support inexperienced literary readers in engaging in interpretation.

<h6>Epistemology Measures</h6>

* **Literature Epistemic Cognition Scale** (LECS; Yukhymenko-Lescroart et al., 2016). The LECS is a Likert scale survey developed to measure epistemological reasoning about fictional texts and how one learns from fiction. The LECS yields subscores for beliefs regarding (1) multiple meanings, (2) the value of re-reading, and (3) the social function of reading literature. There are also several items related to reading habits. The instrument was validated with adolescents (11-18), and more recent research has demonstrated validity with adult populations.

### Absorption (Transportation, Immersion)

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Narrative absorption is a focused form of reading, which leaves the reader unaware of their surroundings, their bodies, and the passage of time (Nell, 1988). In the last decade research on narrative absorption during literary reading has ventured in two contrasting directions. There are those who try to narrow down the conceptualization of absorption to make it more amenable to online physiological measurement (Sukalla, Bilandzic, Bolls & Busselle, 2015; Hsu, Conrad & Jacobs, 2014; Jacobs & Lüdtke, 2017) and there are those who are trying to broaden its conceptualization in order to investigate its relationships to other constructs of interest to the field, such as aesthetic outcomes (Balint, Hakemulder, Kuijpers, Doicaru & Tan, 2016; Kuijpers, Douglas & Kuiken, 2018; Kuiken & Douglas, 2017) or the concept of flow (Thissen, Menninghaus & Schlotz, 2018). In addition, the research has also expanded to include studies that have originated in alternative fields such as medical humanities (Billington et al., 2017) or that are using new methodologies such as machine learning (Rebora, Kuijpers & Lendvai, 2018). This chapter will describe the most recent developments within the field of narrative absorption research and embed them in the context of more established research on the topic.

#### Moniek M. Kuijpers
Postdoctoral research fellow, Gutenberg Institute for Book Science, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany. 

Moniek received her PhD in empirical studies of literature from the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands, in 2014. She continued her work on absorption at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics focusing on personality traits and reading habits of absorbed readers and the problem of how to measure absorption online using eye tracking methodology. Her current research is focused on the mention of absorption in online reader reviews and the relationship between absorbed narrative reading and psychological well-being. Moniek developed a self-report measuring instrument, the Story World Absorption Scale, to capture absorption. She has conducted and published several studies on the effects of various textual devices (i.e., suspense and curiosity structures, foregrounding) on absorption, but also on the individual differences (e.g., personality traits, reading habits) among readers who tend to get absorbed.

#### Melanie C. Green
Full Professor, Department of Communication, University at Buffalo, USA.

Melanie received her Ph.D. from Ohio State University. Her research examines how narratives change the way individuals think and behave, including the effects of fictional stories on real-world attitudes. Her theory of "transportation into a narrative world" focuses on immersion into a story as a mechanism of narrative influence. She has examined narrative persuasion in a variety of contexts, from health communication to social issues. She has edited two books on these topics (*Narrative Impact* and *Persuasion: Psychological Insights and Perspectives, Second Edition*) and published numerous articles in psychology, communication, and interdisciplinary journals. Her work focuses on transportation into a narrative world, including factors that encourage (or discourage) transportation.

#### Shawn Douglas
PhD Candidate, Department of Psychology, University of Alberta, Canada.

Shawn completed his MSc at Trent University in Applied Modelling and Quantitative Methods. He is currently working on his dissertation, further exploring the relationship between metaphorical thinking and self-change following literary reading. His interest in narrative absorption is three-fold: (1) understanding how expressive and integrative thinking are at times at odds and at other times coordinated during absorbed reading; (2) how metaphorical thinking exemplifies, informs, and is informed by absorbed reading, and (3) how life stories are changed or augmented through interaction with literary texts.

#### Don Kuiken
Professor, Department of Psychology, University of Alberta, Canada.

Don specializes in the study of dreams, aesthetics, and phenomenology. He has published journal articles and book chapters concerning self-transformation through significant dreams and significant reading experiences, both of which can be deeply “absorbing.” The notion guiding his research is that a metaphoric and enactive mode of engagement is at work during both impactful dreams and significant reading events. Phenomenological (“qualitative”) studies identified what Don calls expressive enactment (Kuiken, Miall, & Sikora, 2004; Kuiken, Sikora, & Miall, 2011). More recent psychometric efforts have made expressive enactment accessible through self-report measures administered when reading experiences are reaching their conclusion (Kuiken & Douglas, 2017). Current studies address the cumulative and “creative” metaphoricity through which expressive enactment precipitates transformative aesthetic outcomes (e.g., being moved, sublime feeling).

Miruna completed her PhD at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (University of Amsterdam). She now works as researcher and lecturer at NHTV. While exploring narrative absorption in film, she has tried to identify several types of experiences (narrative transportation, narrative engagement, suspense, curiosity, and surprise) and their determinants (narrative structure, film genre, viewer’s preference). She is developing new self-report tools to measure suspense and aesthetic appreciation. She distinguishes between story-world absorption (the story of a film as object of focused attention and emotional engagement) and artifact absorption (the film artifact as object of focused attention and emotional engagement.

#### Birte A. K. Thissen
PhD Candidate, Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

Birte received an MSc degree from Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, in 2015. She then became a PhD candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, studying how so-called "flow experiences" contribute to the pleasure of reading fiction. Flow shares the notion of heightened attentional absorption and intrinsic enjoyment with narrative absorption and, although empirical research on this matter is still scarce, the theoretical link between these different approaches is plausible. In her current PhD project, Birte is gathering empirical evidence for the occurrence of flow during fiction reading and is developing and testing a self-report scale to capture flow during reading as well as investigating potential psychophysiological correlates of flow such as eye movement patterns.

### Culture, Cognition, and Literary Comprehension

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Amidst the growing influence of globalization, people all over the world now have more options to enjoy the same cultural products and read the same literary works. Why is it that globally influential works are able to be accepted and appreciated by people from different cultural backgrounds? Do readers from diverse cultural settings differ in the understanding of topics, characters and plots, or does culture shape the reading in some dimensions, but not in others? How does the conceptualization of L1 influence the literary comprehension of L2? These questions with regards to cross-cultural reading of literary works against the backdrop of globalization require more thorough investigation. 

Literary comprehension is inference-based communication between recipients and texts. Literary texts stimulate the reader’s imagination by means of a structure of “indeterminacy.” Readers use their world knowledge and concepts within their narrative imagination to fill in the indirect description of plot development and role shaping. For this reason, the generation of meaning in literary comprehension is determined by readers' intentionality. It is often stated that language and culture influence the way we think. However, relatively little has been done to investigate how people in different cultures read differently and to what extent literature from different cultural areas has affinity rather than differences. The study on Culture, Cognition and Literary Comprehension explores the extent to which the common ground and literary elements cognitively and emotionally engage readers. The research is conducted under an interdisciplinary framework that involves concepts in psychology, theories in literary studies, and linguistic models.

## Aesthetic and Expressive Effects

### Self-Transcendent Effects of Digital Media (e.g., Film)

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Research in media psychology has historically tended to focus on the harmful effects of viewing (e.g., increases in aggression, heightened prejudice, unhealthy behaviors, etc.). However, over the last decade, an increasing number of scholars have turned their attention to “positive” media psychology, noting the ways in which media may inspire its audiences, may move viewers to heightened compassion and tenderness, and may ultimately serve as the catalyst for pro-social outcomes. This research coalition focuses recent and ongoing scholarship in this area, pointing to the various ways that “being moved” has been conceptualized and tested, including concepts such as appreciation, eudaimonic fulfillment, elevation, self-transcendence, poignancy, kama muta, and awe, among others. We are also interested in the challenges that scholars may face when attempting to harness to the pro-social potentials of inspiring media, and particularly so in the contemporary and rapidly evolving media landscape, and also in the context of “darker” uses of inspiration, such as their use for purposes such as marketing and in maintaining or strengthening in-group ties. We further consider the potential ways that these challenges may be addressed through the use of newer media technologies.

### Openness, Intensive Reflection, and Self-altering Literary Reading

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Studies involving quite different research paradigms have demonstrated that literary reading sometimes changes readers’ sense of themselves and their lived world. Interviews inviting extended self-narration provide evidence that extended engagement with literary texts can precipitate intensive self-reflection and changes in worldview (e.g., Tangerås, 2018). Also, experimental studies that systemically vary reading conditions (e.g., text genres) indicate that engagement with literary (vs. non-literary) texts supports changes in self-relevant attitudes and beliefs (e.g., Dijkic et al., 2009). And, studies that assess modes of reading engagement indicate that open reflection within a distinctively “close” mode of reading engagement triggers “moving” shifts in text comprehension and self-understanding (e.g., Kuiken & Douglas, 2018; Menninghaus et al., 2015). Some evidence reported in these studies suggests that such changes occur especially during transitional or critical life events. There is increased clarity about the processes by which literary reading jointly influences readers’ understanding of their own and the world of the text. Contrasting contemporary formulations propose that (1) readers expand their sense of “possible selves” through engagement with fictional characters’ experiences (Brokerhof, et al., 2018); (2) readers are prompted to change by “defamiliarizing” formal and narrative textual features that motivate the articulation of alternative conceptions of self (Koopman & Hakemulder, 2015) ; and (3) readers are transformed through openly receptive engagement with aspects of text that afford improvisational “performance” of the experienced world of the text (Kuiken & Douglas, 2018). Besides comparatively evaluating these models, researchers in this area are prepared to entertain contributions of further interview studies of readers during life transitions, experimental studies of variations in reading contexts, and process-oriented studies of moment by moment reading activities (and their physiological or behavioral concomitants; e.g., Wassiliwizky et al., 2018).

### Poetry Writing Research

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Over the last decade, the usage of poetry writing has been integrated within research contexts. Poetry writing has been used as a source of data, as a data collection method and as a way of presenting interview data. The integration of poetry as a research method has happened predominantly with the aim of enhancing social understanding and in relation to the ethnographic investigation of individual personal experience and trauma. The field of the scientific study of literature has over the last 25 years generated data and theories which allow a deeper understanding of the way poetry is written and read. However, to date, there is little direct evidence of the way poetic (auto) ethnographies on the psychological processes and outcomes of writing and reading poetic research writing of this type. The aim of the present coalition is to generate new poetic (auto) ethnographic studies and to explicitly study the ramifications of the reading and writing of this type of research poem. The research team is situated in three different countries (Japan, Taiwan and the US) and includes researchers with experience of the range of forms of poetic (auto) ethnographic research. The research coalition wishes to leverage two different aspects of its constituent members: the access to educational settings and our international presence. As a basic design the coalition will generate ethnographic poetic data within our particular contexts and then explore using established research methodologies cross-cultural understandings of poetically expressed experiences. Outcomes of the coalitions work will contribute to the understanding of ways in which poetry is read, written and interacts with critical social change in different cultural contexts.

Dr. Hanauer has taught at Tel-Aviv University, Purdue University, University of California at Berkley and is currently Professor of Applied Linguistics at Indiana University of Pennsylvania and the Lead Educational Researcher and Assessment Coordinator of the SEA-PHAGES Program, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute funded project in the Hatful Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Hanauer is the editor of the *Scientific Study of Literature* journal and the author of 7 books. He has published in a wide range of science, applied linguistics, literacy and educational journals and is the recipient of grants from the NSF, NIH and US Department of Education. His research addresses the empirical and educational aspects of reading and writing poetry. Hanauer’s poetry research can be divided into three areas; 1) research on the genre-specific aspects of poetry reading; 2) research into how poetry is written in a first and second language; & 3) the development of methodologies for using poetry writing as a research method (poetic autoethnography and poetic ethnography). Using primarily psycholinguistic methodologies Hanauer has explored questions of the distinctiveness of reading and writing poetry, beauty judgements in poetry, voice in poetry, the assessment of poetry reading and writing and the educational outcomes of using poetry in educational settings with varied populations.

Dr. Gloria Park is a graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park’s College of Education, and is currently Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in Composition and Applied linguistics at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Park has served as associate editor for *TESOL Journal* for 5 years and has recently edited *TESOL Encyclopedia of English Language Teaching: Teacher Training & Professional Development Volume* (2018). Her editorial experience also included publishing two special issues in *TESOL Journal* and *TESOL Quarterly*, 2014 and 2016, respectively. Her first monograph entitled, *Narratives of East Asian women teachers of English: Where Privilege Meets Marginalization*, was published by Multilingual Matters in 2017 (paperback released in 2018). In addition, Dr. Park’s work has appeared in *TESOL Quarterly, Journal of Language, Identity and Education, TESOL Journal, ELT Journal, Race and Education, System, Teacher Development*, and numerous edited collections. Her research focuses on the lives and experiences of language teachers, whose identities are complicated and contradictory as they move in and out of different linguistic and cultural landscapes. Chronicling the fluid and ever-changing nature of identity narratives is at the core of Dr. Park’s empirical work. Coupled with language teacher identity and teacher education work, Dr. Park focuses on the (auto) ethnographic narratives of gendered lives, especially in the areas of mothering, language teacher identity, and Korean as heritage language learner identity.

Dr. Liao has a Ph.D in Composition and Applied Linguistics from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. In late October 2017, she defended her dissertation, *Translingual Creative Writing Pedagogy: University Teachers’ Transformation on Pedagogical Ideas*, with distinction. Her research centers on teaching poetic autoethnography as translingual pedagogy in first/second/foreign language classrooms. Her poetry writing research addresses three aspects: (1) L1/L2 students’ understanding toward their poetry writing experiences, (2) literacy teachers’ perception toward teaching poetry writing, and (3) the efficacy of teaching poetic autoethnography in educational settings. Her most recent publications explore the use of poetic autoethnography as translingual pedagogy in first-year college composition courses and the ways prospective literacy teachers perceive writing poetry in a second language. Two of her poetry research are under review for publication: (1) a poetic autoethnographic study on the impact of writing poetry in a second language and (2) a curriculum development study on teaching poetry writing in first-year composition courses for translingual orientation.

## Reading Outcomes (Social Cognition)

### Narrative Fiction and Social Cognition

<h4>Abstract</h4>
Fiction—in print, film, and even video games—exposes its consumers not only to storyworlds, but also to characters, their relationships, and a wealth of complex social interactions.  A growing body of research suggests that fiction consumers may learn social skills from stories through various mechanisms, such as identifying with and/or forming parasocial relationships with characters and simulation of social experience via engagement with characters and the story itself.  In this chapter, we will begin by reviewing the principle theories that explain possible mechanisms and potential effects of engaging with fiction.  We will then describe the methods used to investigate the effects of fiction, and present a brief overview of both correlational and experimental findings: there is robust evidence of an association between lifetime exposure to fiction and social cognition, but results from experimental studies have been mixed.  Finally, we will identify the most important gaps in the current research and propose directions for future research.  Despite recent efforts to test the effects of manipulating fiction exposure on a limited range of social cognitive abilities, many aspects of social cognition have yet to be explored, and there is a clear need for longitudinal intervention studies.

* **Author Recognition Test (Genres) (ART–G)** (Mar & Rain, 2015). The ART–G is a measure of print-exposure derived from a measure of lifetime exposure to print that was developed by Stanovich and West (1989). It consists of a list of author names, and respondents are asked to indicate which names they recognize as belonging to authors. Guessing and indiscriminate responding are discouraged by the presence of false names (foils). This instrument is appropriate for measuring the level of exposure to fiction and nonfiction texts, including several sub-genres.

Originally developed by Baron-Cohen, Jolliffe, Mortimore, and Robertson (1997), and closely related to studies of theory-of-mind in children, this measure of mentalizing is appropriate for normally-developing adults. Respondents are asked to identify the mental state a person is experiencing based on a photograph of their eye-region alone, choosing from among four possible responses.

### Absorption (e.g., Transportation) and Attitude Change

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Literature has often been analyzed as an artistic product, but it can also affect how individuals view the real world and themselves. Literature can affect the self, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors by providing new perspectives and experiences for readers. There are several ways in which this change can occur. For example, literary texts may create empathy for characters that may extend to actual groups or social issues.  They may also evoke vivid mental imagery or facilitate a form of experiential reading that leads to a global shift in moral understanding. The effects may be short-term or relatively enduring. This chapter will consider how and when “literature enters life,” as well as future directions for this area of research.

Dr. Green's research examines how narratives can change the way individuals think and behave, including the effects of fictional stories on real-world attitudes. Her theory of "transportation into a narrative world" focuses on immersion into a story as a mechanism of narrative influence. She has examined narrative persuasion in a variety of contexts, from health communication to social issues. She has edited two books on these topics (*Narrative Impact* and *Persuasion: Psychological Insights and Perspectives, Second Edition*), and published numerous articles in psychology, communication, and interdisciplinary journals.

His current research looks at the relationship between literary reading, empathy, and prejudice. His research related to attitude change focuses on differentiating shifts in understanding that are facilitated by inference-driven reading from those that are facilitated by an experiential - and distinctively aesthetic - form of reading that involves a self-implicating and enactive type of empathy. It has focused on two general areas: the experience of one's mortality and moral attitude change.

### Character Engagement (e.g., Identification) and Social Cognition

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Identification constitutes one of the most profound narrative experiences. Although related to immersion and transportation, identification constitutes a unique psychological process. Rather than being engrossed in the narrative-world as a witness, identification entails temporary suspending one’s own self-concept and merging with the character, thus vicariously experiencing the narrative world through that character. Identification has been theorized as a multi-dimensional experiencing, encompassing cognitive (adopting the character’s thought process), emotional (sharing the character’s emotions), and motivational (rooting for the character’s success) facets. Research across disciplines (spanning literature, psychology, and communication) empirically investigates the antecedents and consequences of character identification using both written and audiovisual narratives. 

Collectively, this research draws a complex portrait of this phenomenon. Contrary to the intuitively appealing notion that character-audience similarity lies at the core of character identification, a growing body of research demonstrates that powerful narratives compel audiences to adopt the perspective of characters that may be very different from themselves. Literary devices eliciting identification include first-person storytelling, character likability, and a rich depiction of the character’s inner world.In turn, character identification can alter one’s self-concept and attenuate the audience member’s interpretation of, and enjoyment of, the narrative. Moreover, character identification leads to persuasion and learning effects. These outcomes have been documented in a variety of contexts, including health, inter-group relationships, and support for social policies. 

From a methodological perspective, post-reading self-report measures dominate the field. The validity of this approach, however, comes under increased scrutiny. Recent interdisciplinary research in this area introduced alternatives to assessing identification (e.g., physiological and reaction-task measures). These methodological advances could, ostensibly, reduce self-report biases and/or provide a continuous, online measure of identification. Ultimately, this shift reflects a growing interest in conceptualizing character identification and theorizing its effect as a dynamic process.

Benjamin Johnson’s research is focused on the selection and use of media, especially as it relates to impression management, social comparison, and self-regulation processes. His work on narrative absorption and empathy is focused on the temporarily expanded boundary of the self (TEBOTS) model, which proposes that narratives allow individuals to transcend their limitations of their daily selves to satisfy vicariously their intrinsic needs for self-determination. He has applied the TEBOTS predictions in contexts of self-regulation, self-affirmation, antihero morality, narrative persuasion, targeted advertising, and interactive fandom. His work on narrative and media also considers additional message and social factors such as spoilers, group identity, and social comparison.

<h6>Character Identification Scales</h6>

* **Cohen Identification Scale (Revised)** (Cohen, 2001). This scale measures audience member identification with a specific media character. It assesses identification with narrative characters (fictional or otherwise), such as figures in films, TV shows, or books. Identification involves sharing the perspective of the character, empathizing with the character's emotions, and sharing the character's motivations or goals.

* **Identification with the Character Scale** (Igartua & Barrios (2012). This scale also measures the respondent’s identification with a specific character. The measurement model specifies that identification with characters is a general factor involving three facets: emotional empathy, cognitive empathy, and the sensation of becoming or merging with the character.

### Child Development and Reading for Pleasure

<h4>Abstract</h4>

The tools and technologies through which children engage with narratives are increasingly digital, dynamic, and wearable. The changes to communication in the digital age imply changes to children’s everyday literacy practices: today’s children engage with narratives embedded in online games, interactive apps or video stories. Some are commercial and entertainment-oriented and some specifically designed to support the development of children’s reading and writing skills. Many parents and teachers struggle to support children’s learning with digital media and the rapidly expanding landscape of interactive print stories. In comparison with adults or even teenagers, young children’s engagement with digital literary narratives is little examined. This interdisciplinary Research Coalition explores the extent to which young children’s reading for pleasure is being shaped by the narrative content, materiality, personalization, and interactivity of stories. Materiality, personalization, and interactivity have been foregrounded through the digitization of communication but they remain three key enduring issues in children’s reading for pleasure, implicated in a number of reading-related outcomes such as comprehension, school achievement and empathy.

The aim of the Coalition is for all members to jointly develop a strong knowledge base of current research in the area and agenda for future research. Collaborative research will be encouraged through meetings with members representing a range of disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, education, literary studies, sociology, linguistics, computer science and communication and media studies. In addition to a special issue in *Scientific Study of Literature*, the Coalition aims to advance the field by organizing workshops and online discussions and holding an active dialogue with non-members interested in the Coalition’s mission, such as teachers, publishers and story app developers.

## Reading Outcomes (Mental and Social Well-Being)

### Literary Reading and Explorations of Distress

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Why do we consume entertainment that causes us distress? Although dramas and tragedies have long been a part of our media consumption, empirical research remains limited; instead, scholars have largely focused on the appeal of hedonistic or “escapist” genres, such as light-hearted comedy. In recent years, entertainment psychologists have reinvigorated this inquiry by broadening our understanding of entertainment beyond pleasure-seeking to include meaning-seeking motives (Oliver, 2008; Oliver & Raney, 2011, Wirth, Hofer, & Schramm, 2012). The present review on ‘explorations of distress’ delves into theories and research approaches that explain and investigate the appeal of somber entertainment. 

We start the review with mood management theory’s positivity bias in explaining hedonistic entertainment consumption and enjoyment. Subsequently, we review the more recent eudaimonic entertainment framework that seeks to explain the appreciation of “serious,” reflective content. In the process, other approaches to examining the appeal of somber entertainment are considered, from the theories of excitation transfer to terror management (Hanich, Wagner, Shah, Jacobsen, & Menninghaus, 2014). The review will conclude by taking a closer look at one aspect of the ‘explorations of distress’: the appeal of tragedy. 

Tragedy is broadly defined as a story genre that depicts protagonists who grapple with traumatic events that remain unresolved in the duration of the plot. Along with this genre, the concept of catharsis is also re-examined as a possible audience response to tragic entertainment without recourse to the invalidated venting model. Drawing from clinical psychology (e.g., Lumley et al., 2008), catharsis is re-conceptualized as a beneficial, psychological process that involves *emotional clarification* or the labeling and processing of the audience’s unresolved emotional experiences through a reflective engagement in tragic entertainment. A preliminary model of catharsis through tragic drama is proposed for future experimental research.

### Literary Reading and Mental Well-Being

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Literary reading and health has become an established field in the twenty-first century, impelled in part by the widespread phenomenon of reading groups in Europe and North America. Research has investigated the power of reading groups and shared reading to alleviate mental and physical health conditions (depression, dementia, chronic pain) by encouraging and enhancing mental processes, including: re-appraisal (of difficult experience, attitude towards self and others) and meta-cognition (the ability to think about one’s own thought processes including how to connect affective and cognitive responses and modify cognitive mode). The extent to which the complexity of literary texts (including stylistic and syntactic defamiliarization) helps mediate the observed and reported health benefits of shared reading is one strong current focus of research. Shared reading groups as a technology to enable emotionally sharing human communities is equally an important strand of exploration.

Published research crosses diverse disciplines – literature, linguistics, medicine, sociology, and psychology. It also employs a wide breadth of approaches. These range from: (i) established methods applied in a new area: psychological experimentation and/or health/well-being measurement using standardized quantitative tools; experiential and qualitative approaches including Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, Discourse Analysis, Ethnographic fieldwork. (ii) new quantitative tools for analyzing the phenomenology of reading; innovative qualitative methods (video-assisted interviews, for example, where reading-group participants are returned to the lived presence of their reading experience, as well as micro-phenomenological analysis of significant self-altering moments in reading). (iii) multi-disciplinary and multi-dimensional approaches which combine observational or experiential approaches, with, for example, physiological measures (of real-time heart rate, galvanic skins response when reading texts) to capture and measure the underlying biological mechanisms involved in the dynamic cognition, affective/emotional reactions and animated thought produced by reading.

<h6>Mood Scales</h6>

* **Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)** (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report measure made up of two 10-item mood scales, i.e., two sets of words describing different states and emotions: 10 positive (e.g. interested, excited), 10 negative (e.g. nervous, jittery). Participants indicate next to each word the extent to which they are experiencing each emotion or state on a scale of 1- 5 (1 = not all; 5 = extremely). The scale can be used in pre/post test studies, or for capturing snapshot and real-time data.

<h6>Qualitative Methods</h6>

* **Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis** (Smith, Flowers, & Larkin, 2009). Derived from the philosophy of Edmund Husserl, Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) is a qualitative empirical approach that explores lived experience ‘from the inside,’ rather than starting from theoretical preconceptions or offering objective accounts of human experience.  IPA seeks to provide detailed examination of individual perceptions and meanings in relation to specific events, objects, or states by attending to and inhabiting another’s perspective or life-world. Since the approach involves a double interpretative endeavor (making sense of how a person makes sense of the world), the researcher is required repeatedly to return to participant testimony and ensure that interpretation is based in the participants’ life-view. IPA is thus intellectually connected to hermeneutics (the theory of interpretation).

### Empirical Ecocriticism

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Empirical ecocriticism is an emerging subfield of ecocriticism that focuses on the empirically grounded study of environmental narrative – in literature, film, television, etc. – and its influence on various audiences. The main objective of empirical ecocriticism is to put to test empirically claims made within ecocriticism, and the environmental humanities more generally, about the impact of environmental narratives. To this end, it employs empirical methods used in disciplines such as environmental communication, environmental psychology, and the empirical study of literature. These include correlational and experimental studies, qualitative research, and others. As currently defined, empirical ecocriticism is (a) empirically grounded; (b) open to qualitative and exploratory methodologies; (c) focused on the effects of narrative strategies and techniques, with the kind of depth and nuance that cultural critics have brought to their research for decades; and (d) open to critical engagement with competing conceptions of “empirical” data. One the central aims of this interdisciplinary field is to gain a better understanding of the role of environmental narratives in influencing people’s awareness, attitudes, and behavior in a time of rapid social and ecological transformation. Combining approaches from the humanities and the social sciences, empirical ecocriticism explores the ways in which people from various cultural backgrounds engage with environmental narratives and the larger repercussions of such engagement.

**Coalition Objectives**

The main objective of empirical ecocriticism is to put to empirical test claims made within ecocriticism, and the environmental humanities more generally, about the impact of environmental narratives. To this end, it employs empirical methods used in disciplines such as environmental communication, environmental psychology, and the empirical study of literature. These include correlational and experimental studies, and others. 

In its current working definition, empirical ecocriticism is

* Empirically grounded
* Open to qualitative and exploratory methodologies
* Focused on the effects of narrative strategies and techniques, with the kind of depth and nuance that cultural critics have brought to their research for decades
* Open to critical engagement with competing definitions of “empirical” data

While empirical ecocriticism focuses on employing established empirical methods, it therefore remains open to different characterizations of empirical data and to the use of humanistic methods as well, including those characteristic of traditional ecocriticism, such as textual and historical analysis.

For more information about this emerging coalition, follow this link: [Empirical Ecocriticism](https://empiricalecocriticism.com/). Recently the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society hosted a [workshop on Empirical Ecocriticism](https://www.carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de/events_conf_seminars/event_history/2018-events-history/conferences2018/empirical-ecocriticism-ws/index.html).

## History, Theory, and Method

### Philosophy of Science, Methodology, and Theory Development

<h4>Abstract</h4>
This coalition focuses on philosophical, methodological, and theoretical challenges and opportunities in the scientific study of literary response, experience, and interpretation. Insofar as this “model-driven, multilevel, multimethod” enterprise (Jacobs et al., 2016) draws upon the paradigms of distinct disciplines, it inherits a wide range of paradigmatic problems. From philosophy of mind, the field inherits the “explanatory gap” between neurophysiological data and phenomenological experience. From (cognitive) psychology come methodological issues involved in the investigation of non-quantitative constructs that cannot be directly observed and that vary nontrivially across individuals and contexts. And from linguistics and literary studies arise a host of theoretical and ethical concerns relating to the nature and ontology of the object of inquiry (“literature,” “literary experience”) and its uses in individual lives and institutional practices. The important theoretical question emerges as to whether modeling in such an interdisciplinary science will proceed with a truly integrative as opposed to a merely additive ambition. Urging the former, members of this coalition have posited various ways that literary history and professional literary interpretation might contribute to a more integrative approach to the scientific study of literature.

#### Mark Bruhn
Professor of English Literature, Regis University, Denver, USA.

With a study of deixis published in 2005, Mark’s research took a turn toward “historical cognitive poetics,” which aims to assess the ways in which historical theories, practices, and interpretations of literature may contribute to present-day cognitive and empirical literary studies. His scholarship focuses on Romantic poetry in general and Wordsworth’s in particular, including a monograph Wordsworth Before Coleridge (Routledge, 2018) and contributions to Cognition, Literature, and History (Routledge, 2014), The Oxford Handbook of William Wordsworth (2015), The Palgrave Handbook of Affect Studies and Textual Criticism (2017), the de Gruyter Handbook of British Romanticism (2017), and Romanticism and Consciousness Revisited (2022). His literary-critical essays on English literature from Chaucer to Atwood have appeared in such journals as The Chaucer Review, European Romantic Review, Poetics Today, Studies in Philology, Studies in Romanticism, and The Wallace Stevens Journal.

#### Emily T. Troscianko
Research Associate, The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities (TORCH), Oxford University, Oxford, UK.

Emily's research hovers between cognitive literary studies and the health humanities. She has published a monograph on the psychological effects of reading Kafka (Kafka's Cognitive Realism, 2014) and is co-author of the third edition of a textbook on consciousness (Consciousness: An Introduction, 2018). Her work in empirical literary studies began with an investigation of how scientific and philosophical perspectives on mental imagery and emotional responses help us understand the "Kafkaesque" power of Kafka's prose style. More recently (and especially relevant to this coalition), her publications have included a coauthored paper for Poetics Today (2018) entitled "Interpretation: Its status as object or method of study in cognitive and unnatural narratology".  Emily conducts empirical studies on readers' responses to textual features using forced-choice, survey, and verbal/pictorial free-response procedures, as well as computational linguistics and eye-tracking methods. Her current work focuses mostly on whether readers' interactions with texts are therapeutically relevant (in positive or negative ways), taking eating disorders as a case study.

#### Don Kuiken
Professor, Department of Psychology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

Don specializes in the study of dreams, aesthetics, and phenomenology. He has published journal articles and book chapters concerning self-transformation through significant dreams and significant reading experiences, both of which involve metaphoric generativity. The notion guiding his research is that a metaphoric and enactive mode of identification is at work during both impactful dreams and significant reading events. Phenomenological (“qualitative”) studies identified what he calls expressive enactment (Kuiken, Miall, & Sikora, 2004; Kuiken, Sikora, & Miall, 2011). His conception of this mode of reading engagement emerged at the interface between philosophical phenomenology, literary theory, and empirical studies in psychology. He has developed phenomenological (“qualitative”) methods that provide a balance between sensitivity and rigor in the explication of experiential accounts (Kuiken, Schopflocher, & Wild, 1989; Kuiken & Miall, 2001; Sikora, Kuiken, & Miall, 2011).

### History of Empirical Studies of Literature

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Following David West (2017, 2013) the experiments included by IA Richards in *Practical criticism: A study of literary Judgement*  “were the first large-scale experiments in psychology conducted to discover how real readers understand, interpret and evaluate literary texts” (2017: 88). Yet already in 1921, Karl Girgensohn, a Lutheran theologist who had been professor in Greifswald and Leipzig, had published protocols of the experiments on readers of several religious poems, which he began in 1911. His (14) subjects had to read the poems while their reading time was measured and afterwards they reported their reading experience and give a subjective evaluation of the poems. Although Girgensohn was more interested in the psychology of religion than in the aesthetic experience of the literary text, he undoubtedly used an empirical method to study the interaction between the reader and the text and, surprisingly, a method that is still in use. It was another contemporary who baptized this type of research. An almost unknown writer and lecturer, Richard Müller-Freienfels (1882-1942), published in 1914 a small volume entitled *Poetik*, which aimed to provide a psychological understanding of poetry and its reception. He called his approach “empirical literary science” (“empirische Literaturwissenschaft”, 1914: 17)

Regardless of which date for the origin of empirical studies of literature is considered most reliable, we can argue that the research field has been in existence for around a century. Remarkably, no history of the empirical aesthetics of literature has yet been written and no effort has been made to connect the empirical research carried out after 1900 with the “Pre-Empirical and Empirical Poetics since 1820” (Richter 2009, 129-176), including that of Gustav Theodor Fechner and Wilhelm Dilthey.  Nobody has mapped the evolution of this research approach in which the German and American traditions played a major role although starting from completely different scientific premises. And, of course it would be useful to see the relation of the evolution of this research field with its institutionalization in scientific associations such as IGEL (founded in 1987 in Siegen; Steen 2003) and to analyze the role of international journals that have offered publication venues for this kind of analysis of literary reading (*SSOL, Spiel, PACA, Poetics*).
