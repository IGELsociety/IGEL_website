## Research coalitions
In recent years, IGEL has supported the formation of 21 research coalitions within our community. These coalitions are small groups of 3-8 researchers concerned with specific topics in empirical studies of literature (e.g., literary reading and social cognition, shared literary reading). These coalitions work together to prepare publications, training material or events on their research topic, most recently they formed the basis for the 21 chapters of the [Handbook of Empirical Literary Studies](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110645958/html).

On the left you can find all of our currently active research coalitions grouped per theme (i.e, Modes of Textual Representation; The Form and Function of Literariness; Social Effects of Literary Reading; Narrative Engagement and Experiential Depth; Enhanced Social Well-Being; History, Theory and Empirical Methods). For each coalition you can find its members, their most important publications on the topic, and some relevant resources. 

If you would like to join a research coalition, please contact the specific research coalition's coordinator

### Submitting a Coalition Proposal
If you are interested in starting a new research coalition involving a small group of investigators with records of accomplishment in a specific research area, please send an email to Moniek Kuijpers (IGEL President) who, in turn, will present your proposal to the Board for consideration.

## Modes of Textual Representation

### Effects of Foregrounding
	
<h4>Abstract</h4>
One of the central goals of the empirical study of literature is to determine the nature and function of literary reading. In this, researchers often attribute a decisive role to foregrounding, a phenomenon that occurs either when some aspect of a text is either some form of repetition or unusual in terms of some general norm (external deviation) or deviating from a pattern set up by the text itself (internal deviation). For some, it is key to their understanding of what constitutes literariness, or even art in general. The aim of the foregrounding research coalition is to foster the empirical study of foregrounding, in order to enhance our understanding of what literariness is.

For this we need to distinguish four approaches to the ontology of foregrounding: (1) foregrounding seen as textual procedures (also referred to as deviations and parallelism); (2) foregrounding considered as a phenomenon occurring in the perception of readers (i.e., noticing that something is different in comparison to its context); (3) readers’ experience of foregrounding; and (4) the effects of such experiences in the culture at large. These four conceptions are interdependent and interactive, but only to a degree. To start with, readers will only perceive a deviation if the relevant information about context is available to them (e.g., their knowledge of genre conventions). And if perceived, there are still a number of factors that determine whether and how they interpret the intentionality and purpose of the deviation or parallelism and the whether they experience foregrounding in the sense of an aesthetic or distinctly literary response (e.g., readers’ attitude toward literary values). The research in this coalition focuses on the second and third approach. However, in our interdisciplinary group we will also consider the first, for instance in the formulation of hypotheses, and explore implications for the fourth.

Thus, our research coalition represents (and brings together) a wide range of topics, such as, reader variables that predict susceptibility to foregrounding; the way the interplay between deviation and parallelism affects responses; the relationship between backgrounding and foregrounding, the relation between foregrounding and perceived meaningfulness; foregrounding in other media than literary texts (e.g., film and music).

#### Davide Castiglione
Lecturer in English language and literature, Vilnius University, Lithuania

Davide teaches poetry, stylistics, and other linguistic disciplines. In his research on the stylistics of difficulty he has identified a checklist of linguistic indicators that tend to be foregrounded in difficult poems, thus favouring certain kinds of response over others. Belonging to all linguistic levels, but especially to semantics and pragmatics (discourse), these features are foregrounded both internally (e.g. they are highly salient in defining the texture of the given poem) and externally (e.g. they deviate from prototypical norms of language, both literary and non-literary).

#### Frank Hakemulder
Assistant Professor, Department of Media and Culture Studies, Utrecht University, The Netherlands; Affiliated Full Professor at the Reading Center of Stavanger University, Norway

Frank has a background in literary theory and comparative literature. His research focuses on the effects of reading literary texts on outgroup attitudes and moral self-concept (e.g., The moral laboratory, 2000). He supervises two national research projects in the Netherlands: one pertaining to the experience of being absorbed in fictional worlds (Narrative Absorption, 2017), and the other on how such experiences affect social perception and self concepts (see www.finditinfiction.org). Currently he is investigating how literary reading gives readers a sense of meaningfulness in studies of text qualities (e.g., foregrounding), how readers are instructed to read, reading medium (screen versus paper), and how these interact to generate deeply absorbed, eudaemonic experiences.

## Reading Outcomes (Mental and Social Well-Being)

### Literary Reading and Explorations of Distress

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Why do we consume entertainment that causes us distress? Although dramas and tragedies have long been a part of our media consumption, empirical research remains limited; instead, scholars have largely focused on the appeal of hedonistic or “escapist” genres, such as light-hearted comedy. In recent years, entertainment psychologists have reinvigorated this inquiry by broadening our understanding of entertainment beyond pleasure-seeking to include meaning-seeking motives (Oliver, 2008; Oliver & Raney, 2011, Wirth, Hofer, & Schramm, 2012). The present review on ‘explorations of distress’ delves into theories and research approaches that explain and investigate the appeal of somber entertainment. 

We start the review with mood management theory’s positivity bias in explaining hedonistic entertainment consumption and enjoyment. Subsequently, we review the more recent eudaimonic entertainment framework that seeks to explain the appreciation of “serious,” reflective content. In the process, other approaches to examining the appeal of somber entertainment are considered, from the theories of excitation transfer to terror management (Hanich, Wagner, Shah, Jacobsen, & Menninghaus, 2014). The review will conclude by taking a closer look at one aspect of the ‘explorations of distress’: the appeal of tragedy. 

Tragedy is broadly defined as a story genre that depicts protagonists who grapple with traumatic events that remain unresolved in the duration of the plot. Along with this genre, the concept of catharsis is also re-examined as a possible audience response to tragic entertainment without recourse to the invalidated venting model. Drawing from clinical psychology (e.g., Lumley et al., 2008), catharsis is re-conceptualized as a beneficial, psychological process that involves *emotional clarification* or the labeling and processing of the audience’s unresolved emotional experiences through a reflective engagement in tragic entertainment. A preliminary model of catharsis through tragic drama is proposed for future experimental research.

### History of Empirical Studies of Literature

<h4>Abstract</h4>

Following David West (2017, 2013) the experiments included by IA Richards in *Practical criticism: A study of literary Judgement*  “were the first large-scale experiments in psychology conducted to discover how real readers understand, interpret and evaluate literary texts” (2017: 88). Yet already in 1921, Karl Girgensohn, a Lutheran theologist who had been professor in Greifswald and Leipzig, had published protocols of the experiments on readers of several religious poems, which he began in 1911. His (14) subjects had to read the poems while their reading time was measured and afterwards they reported their reading experience and give a subjective evaluation of the poems. Although Girgensohn was more interested in the psychology of religion than in the aesthetic experience of the literary text, he undoubtedly used an empirical method to study the interaction between the reader and the text and, surprisingly, a method that is still in use. It was another contemporary who baptized this type of research. An almost unknown writer and lecturer, Richard Müller-Freienfels (1882-1942), published in 1914 a small volume entitled *Poetik*, which aimed to provide a psychological understanding of poetry and its reception. He called his approach “empirical literary science” (“empirische Literaturwissenschaft”, 1914: 17)

Regardless of which date for the origin of empirical studies of literature is considered most reliable, we can argue that the research field has been in existence for around a century. Remarkably, no history of the empirical aesthetics of literature has yet been written and no effort has been made to connect the empirical research carried out after 1900 with the “Pre-Empirical and Empirical Poetics since 1820” (Richter 2009, 129-176), including that of Gustav Theodor Fechner and Wilhelm Dilthey.  Nobody has mapped the evolution of this research approach in which the German and American traditions played a major role although starting from completely different scientific premises. And, of course it would be useful to see the relation of the evolution of this research field with its institutionalization in scientific associations such as IGEL (founded in 1987 in Siegen; Steen 2003) and to analyze the role of international journals that have offered publication venues for this kind of analysis of literary reading (*SSOL, Spiel, PACA, Poetics*).
