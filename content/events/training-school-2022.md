## About Event

In line with the theme of the 2022 conference, Franziska Hartung, Raymond Mar and Federico Pianzola will coordinate a training school on the topic of Open Science.

The aims of the Training School are to teach early career researchers the basics of Open Science.
Open Science is a movement devoted to **making scientific research replicable, accessible, transparent, and open to evaluation** by others.
We will be covering issues as varied as preregistration, open access publishing, repositories for data and materials, and data management and reproducibility.
The participants will learn about data management plans and the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reuse) principles, along with online services like GitHub and OSF.io.
During the training school **attendees will have the chance to apply Open Science principles to their own projects through hands-on sessions**.
