## About Event

This year’s IGEL Training School will take place on Tuesday 10th and Wednesday 11th June 2025. 
In line with the theme of the 2025 conference, the Training School will focus on **"Artificial Intelligence and Research: Its Potential and Limitations"**,  with an emphasis on the intersection of AI and narratives.
The event will be held entirely online via Zoom and will run for two days, each session lasting between 1 hour 15 minutes and 1 hour 30 minutes. A detailed timetable will be shared before the event. There is no fee to participate, as this event is free of charge.
The aim of this year’s Training School is to provide MA and PhD students, early-career scholars, and anyone interested in the field of AI and narrative research the opportunity to explore the potentials and limitations of AI within the realm of literature and storytelling. 

The event will feature prominent experts from the field:

- Rik van Noord will present a session discussing the potentials and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for research, examining how these technologies can assist or hinder narrative analysis.
– Melanie Walsh will introduce the AI for Humanists initiative, highlighting resources available for scholars working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and the Humanities.
– Robert Lewis will bring his expertise in media enjoyment and communication science to discuss how AI intersects with mass media, narrative engagement, or audience interaction, to name a few.

Participants will engage in both theoretical and applied components of AI in narrative research, learning about the challenges and opportunities presented by these emerging technologies. Students will have the chance to apply some of the knowledge gained through hands-on activities during the sessions.
Note: More senior researchers who might not be interested in the Training School may feel absolutely free to forward this to their students or anyone else they think might benefit from the event.
