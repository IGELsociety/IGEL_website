You can email the IGEL board at: board [at] igelsociety [dot] org

There is also a [IGEL Subscriber Mailing List](https://www.mailman.srv.ualberta.ca/mailman/listinfo/igel). You can use it to circulate information, announcements, and brief discussions of general interest to members of the Society and friends of the Society. Note: Postings on this list are sent to subscribers who are IGEL members but also to subscribers who are **not** IGEL members.
